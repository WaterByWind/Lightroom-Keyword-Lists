# Lightroom Keyword Lists

Controlled-vocabulary of various parklands, preserves, refuges, and similar properties for use as Adobe Lightroom keyword lists.

Partly inspired by the [Lightroom Keyword List Project](http://lightroom-keyword-list-project.blogspot.gr) these are being offered as additional specialized supplemental lists for those that may be interested in such detailed tagging.

In particular, landscape and nature photographers may desire to tag and categorize the locations of their work for various reasons.  Such photography often takes place in parklands, preserves, and refuges and the ability to note these locations as metadata for each capture may be useful or interesting.  The lists here are intended for such use.

The keyword lists here are an attempt to create a controlled vocabulary to facilitate consistency and simplify creation and use of such key-wording.  Note that in most cases only the name of the park/preserve will be exported by default, such as when sharing to social media or online photo libraries and sharing sites.  It is the park/preserve nomenclature that is relevant for this controlled vocabulary, and there are many other methodologies for geographical tagging.  These lists are organized within Lightroom using a geographical hierarchy but that detail would not be exported as-is for that reason.

These lists include the formal name of each land/property/site, as well as additional common names when applicable.

#### Corrections and updates
By their nature these lists are expected to change over time, particularly those of international and national lands.  Unless otherwise noted the lists are complete at the time of creation, but it should be expected that over time there may be omissions or no-longer-current items.  When possible, these lists will be periodically appropriately updated.

Suggestions for updates, additions, and corrections will always be welcome and appreciated.

#### How do I use these?
These lists are presented as ready-to-use lists to be directly imported into Lightroom.  For instructions, please see the [Adobe Lightroom Help Reference](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/help/keywords.html#import_and_export_keywords)

Each of these lists may be individually imported separately, or they may be easily merged into a single larger hierarchy.  The lists can be somewhat large and so are presented in a modular fashion providing flexibility while maintaining the controlled vocabulary.

#### Are these licensed? Are these free?
All of the lists here are created from readily-available public information.  While compiling these involved a bit of tedious manual effort they are being made freely available under a Creative Commons license.

## The Lists
Each of the items below may be individually downloaded and used, or they may be obtained all together.

### ParksPreserves.txt
One suggested top-level hierarchy in which to fit the rest of the lists below.  The lists may be manually combined before importing into Lightroom, however it may be easier to import the lists as-is then simply drag-n-drop within the Lightroom Keyword List dialogue itself.

### Parks-National-NPS.txt
Hierarchical list of [US National Parks Service Units](http://www.nps.gov), organized by state.

### Parks-National-NWRS.txt
Hierarchical list of [U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System](http://www.fws.gov/refuges) units, organized by state and management complex (if applicable).

In some areas NWRS manages a group of lands/properties together as a single complex.  This detail may not be particularly useful when tagging or categorizing photos but since this is how the NWRS presents these units it is included here for those that may be interested.

### Parks-National-NWRS-NoComplex.txt
Hierarchical list of [U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System](http://www.fws.gov/refuges) units, organized by state.  Does not include management complex detail.

This may be easier to use than the listing including management complexes, and is otherwise identical to the above list.

### Parks-State-_XX_.txt
Hierarchical list of individual state park units.

### Parks-County-_XX_.txt
Hierarchical list of county parklands within each state.

### Parks-Town-_XX_.txt
Hierarchical list of town parklands within each state.

### Parks-Other.txt
Hierarchical list of parks that do not fit within any of the above categories.  These include privately owned/managed lands, estates, trust/foundation properties, and similar.
